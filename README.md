# blackbeard-extension

Blackbeard is a basic example of a [GitHub Copilot Extension](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/using-extensions-to-integrate-external-tools-with-copilot-chat). It responds to messages like a pirate, using Copilot's LLM API and special system prompts. This repository should serve as an example of the building blocks of a Copilot Extension. See [index.js](/index.js) for the main logic.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot Extensions are in public beta and may be subject to change.
> 
> All enrolled users with a GitHub Copilot Individual subscription can use Copilot Extensions.
