# blackbeard-extension

Blackbeard is a basic example of an agent-based GitHub Copilot Extension. It responds to messages like a pirate, using Copilot's LLM API and special system prompts. This repository should serve as an example of the building blocks of a Copilot Extension. See [index.ts](src/index.ts) for the main logic.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot Extensions are in public preview and may be subject to change.
>
> All enrolled users with a GitHub Copilot Individual subscription can use Copilot Extensions.
> For organizations and enterprises with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise subscription, organization owners and enterprise administrators can grant access to Copilot Extensions for use within their company.
